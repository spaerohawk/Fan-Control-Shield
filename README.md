# Fan-Control-Shield
 ## Design files for Fan Control Shield for Nucleo f4x9zi.
  
 Designed by Chris Dougherty while a graduate student at Caltech. 
 
 These design files are open-sourced pursuant to requirements set forth by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). A total of two research-grade fan array wind tunnels (FAWTs) were designed and developed to assist experimental campaign efforts to chamber-test Ingenuity (Mars Helicopter) in simulated Martian forward flight conditions. Given the multi-sourcedness of fan arrays, printed circuit breakout boards that neatly interface with multiples of fan units designed to meet electrical/thermal specifications and off-gassing chamber requirements were set forth in the scope of work.
 
- A 11x11x1 fan array was constructed in the basement of GALCIT using the Fan Control Shield found in release [v1.0.0](https://github.com/spaerohawk/Fan-Control-Shield/releases/tag/v1.0.0). 
* A 21x21x2 fan array[^1] was constructed in the 25-ft Space Simulator at JPL using the Fan Control Shield found in release v1.1.0.
